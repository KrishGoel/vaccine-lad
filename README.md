# Vaccine Lad

> A Telegram Bot that performs the cron job of checking the CoWIN API Endpoints for any open vaccine slots. Built using GitHub Actions and Python.

I mainly did this micro-project to increase my knowledge of server-sided Python, GitHub Actions, and API endpoints.

I achieved the ability to send a notification to my Telegram through this bot. The leftover code is just plain logic and the result however satisfying, wouldn't be worth it in terms of the product hence I am abandoning the code.

I have still attached all the resources you would need to take it up from here. Feel free to hit me up anytime in case you'd wanna discuss anything about this code.

## Functioning
The essential idea is to scan through the response JSON obtained from the CoWIN APIs and filter the qualifying entries (in my case, ```min_age_limit``` = 18 and ```available_capacity``` > 5).

However, the issue that arises with this approach is the fact that the CoWIN APIs return responses for each district and each day, so anyone comfortable with going around the whole town (Delhi for me) would have to run 77 searches (11 districts in Delhi x 7 days of the week) each time the Bot performs the cron job. This is where the code got boring for me and I left it, it isn't a big issue and can easily be worked out.

Once the code finds a qualifying entry, it will generate a message including the details of the venue, day, vaccine name, etc, and shoot it over Telegram. Which is again piss easy but demanding. I have already completed the notification segment of the code, you can see it at [notify.py](/notify.py).

- Creating a Telegram Bot
    1. Open the Telegram app and search for @BotFather. 
    2. Click on the start button or send “/start”. 
    3. Send “/newbot” message to set up a name and a username. 
    4. After setting-up the name and the username BotFather will give you an API token which is your bot token. 
    5. For the next steps, I slacked out and used [@get_id_bot](https://t.me/get_id_bot) to get a ```CHAT_ID```. A much better method would be to use ```telebot``` and ```telethon``` as suggested in this article [Send a message to Telegram user using Python by GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send-message-to-telegram-user-using-python/).

A major shoutout to [@plibither8](https://github.com/plibither8) for helping me along the way and providing references.
